# Text Classification with CNN in PyTorch

This project is a simple text classification pipeline using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch. It includes:

- Data preprocessing using NLTK and Pandas
- Model definition and training
- Evaluation with classification metrics
- Deployment-ready `app.py` using Gradio, suitable for hosting on Hugging Face Spaces

---

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- NLTK
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Gradio

(See `requirements.txt` for exact versions.)

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train the Model

Run the training pipeline in a Jupyter environment:

```bash
jupyter notebook training.ipynb
```

This will save the trained model to `textcnn_model.pth`.

### 4. Run the Gradio App

```bash
python app.py
```

Or deploy to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) by uploading:

- `app.py`
- `textcnn_model.pth`
- `requirements.txt`

---

## Model Architecture

The model is a **TextCNN**:
- Embedding layer
- Multiple convolutional layers with varying kernel sizes
- Max pooling
- Fully connected output layer

It performs text classification based on tokenized, preprocessed inputs.

---

## Notes

- The app expects a `textcnn_model.pth` file trained and saved locally.
- Tokenization and stopword removal are handled via NLTK.
- Two pickle files are required for mapping words to token IDs:
  - `word_to_id.pkl`: dictionary mapping words to integer IDs.
  - `id_to_label.pkl`: dictionary mapping IDs back to words (useful for interpretation or debugging).
- These files must be saved in the same directory as `app.py`, as the app loads them at runtime.

---

## Files

- `training.ipynb` â€” training pipeline
- `app.py` â€” Gradio app
- `textcnn_model.pth` â€” saved model (created after training)
- `requirements.txt` â€” dependencies
- `word_to_id.pkl` â€” word to integer ID mapping
- `id_to_label.pkl` â€” integer ID to word mapping

---

## Example

Once deployed, you can enter text like:

> `"The product was amazing and delivery was fast!"`

And receive a predicted label (e.g., `positive`, `negative`, etc.).
